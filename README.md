This will serve as a private repository for a Vulkan API template. Currently it just has the rudimentary systems set up. All it does is render the basic triagnle. I'm too tired to write this right now so I'll just write build instructions and call it for now. Pretty sure this only supports Linux for now but I will fix it to use a cross-platform thing idk

# Requirements
- CMake
- Make

# Build Instructions
Open a terminal in the root project folder
Type the commands, 
> mkdir build
>
> cd build
>
> cmake ..
>
> make
