This will serve as a private repository for a Vulkan API template. Currently it just has the rudimentary systems set up. All it does is render the basic triagnle. This is just for me personally to use, so I don't have to set up Vulkan every time I want to do a project with it. I do not recommend you use this, if you want a good Vulkan template there are probably way better templates out there. This was created using the tutorial at [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction)
